- 👋 Hi, I’m @fjoshua1995
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code, to get access to different and more challenging jobs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning quite literally the basics! Excited for this adventure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... support groups? I'd love to learn what other beginner and intermediate coders are learning, I believe it will help me advance more effectively, and perhaps I can share a few things and also encourage others!
- 📫 How to reach me ... fjoshua1995@gmail.com is best for email!
